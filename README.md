My name is Brian. I'm currently an Honours Computer Science student at UBC. Here are some things I made:

- ⌨️ [My own text editor in C++](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/step-writer).
- 🏃 [An ice-breaker game where you run around inside a building competing for rooms](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/RoomRival).
- 🧑‍🏫 [A web app where you rate can review and rate your teachers](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/TARA).
- 🍣 [A rhythm sushi eating game](https://youtu.be/Gcul3Cpx8Pk).
- 📖 [My blog where I talk about things](https://www.brianmoniaga.com/Blog).
