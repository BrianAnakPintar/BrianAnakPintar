# Welcome.<img src="Dancing Gopher.gif" alt="go-img" title="Simple Image" width="70"/>

My name is Brian. I'm currently an Honours Computer Science student at UBC. I spend my days looking at code. I also do a lot of Go and C++, both at work and at home.

Here are some of my old projects:
- ⌨️ [My own text editor in C++](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/step-writer).
- 🐸 [A TUI markdown presentation tool](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/frosch).
- 🐰 [A game in C++ from scratch for my course](https://github.com/dayshaunlee/bnuuys-ship).
- 📖 [My blog where I talk about things](https://www.brianmoniaga.com/Blog).


I'm currently working on [another game](https://github.com/BrianAnakPintar/ducktape) (in Go this time) because I want to properly write one with proper planning this time!

You can learn more about me in my site [here](https://brianmoniaga.com/).
